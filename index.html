          Goods rating: Great quality, fair quantity for the price.<br><br>
          Communication rating: Very poor. Continually delayed goods in the past, says the most recent order was lost by the print shop at the beginning of the year and they will refund. Fails to respond to DMs about this refund that I’ve been waiting for since March, and when they do actually respond it’s incredibly late. Eventually said they they don't have the money to refund and stopped replying altogether. They’ve been pretty nice in their (scarce) replies, but my buyers still lost out on their money.<br><br>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Suppose you see an item that you want, but there's no group order manager. Or there is a manager, but you don't know/trust/like them for whatever reason. Or there's a Korean site you want to order an item from, but they don't accept foreign cards. Or there is a low amount of people interested in a fansite item, but you still want to purchase it.

					3. You confirm the information and I send your invoice.<br>

					<p>Before 1st payment deadline = Yes. It's best to do it sooner rather than later, though. If you give me less than 3 days notice, that's a strike against you. If you do this 3 times, you will be banned from ordering with me in the future. You should be committed to an order when you sign up. I understand emergencies and unexpected things can happen, but it is still your responsibility to take care of things ASAP and not wait until the last minute.<br><br>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>The song "Cool World" by Red Velvet. It's one of my favorite songs of theirs and the lyric "If you feel out of place anywhere / I'll save a spot for you right here" has a very special meaning to me. I thought it was fitting to give my frequent buyers a name that shows how much I appreciate them continually ordering from me. :)</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I become a GOM? Do you have any tips?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>First off, I only recommend becoming a GOM for fandoms that don't have any or only have a small amount. I promise you it's just gonna stress you out if you try to jump into a big fandom like EXO or BTS where there's already a million managers and some of them are REALLY territorial about certain group members and/or fansites. Also being new and dealing with the mass amounts of buyers in those fandoms is probably not the best way to start your GOM life because of the high stress levels. But that's just my opinion! So if you really wanna do it that way, then go for it.<br><br>
						
						Deadlines are important. The fansite will always put them in KST, so make sure you check what that is in your timezone and adjust your own deadlines accordingly. You want to leave yourself enough time to make the payments and in case any last minute issues pop up, like a dropout or a late payment etc. Sometimes the fansites will close orders earlier too, so be mindful of that.<br><br>
						
						Also, Google spreadsheets and forms are your best friend, I promise.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">When will items ship from your Korean address?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There is never a set time for this. I wait until I have enough goods to fill a box within the time frame that Korgou allows free storage (30 days), which could be 2 weeks or a month.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do you decide what GOs to open?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>This is taken directly from an Ask:<br><br>
					Honestly it's primarily based on groups and/or the specific members I like.<br><br>
					Then I decide based on need, like if there's a manager already that I see on the fansite's Twitter, I don't open. There's some Red Velvet fansites who I've handled their projects since mid-2016 who I'll always open for though.<br><br>
					The deadline and cost are additional factors, as well as if I know some of my regular buyers are also fans of that group/member and would be interested enough to buy it.<br><br>
					I'm less picky with what I open now than what I used to, because now that I use Korgou to bundle stuff I can still push through small orders without the EMS being ridiculously high.</p>
